## [0.1.5] - 2025-10-05
### Added
- Hash heading normalization tests covering missing-space variants, trailing stray hashes, and deep level headings.

### Changed
- Improved hash heading auto-fix: now converts `#Title`, `##Title`, `#  Title  ` and `# Title #` forms reliably to proper `==` / `=` style.
- Quick fix for hash headings now mirrors auto-fix logic (uses heading level instead of word-count heuristic; trims stray hashes & extra spaces).
- Malformed equals-style heading normalization made more robust (prevents duplicated or partially malformed replacements).

### Fixed
- Prevented duplication when converting malformed hash or equals headings in combination with completion suggestions.
- Ensured trailing stray `#` characters are removed instead of retained in normalized headings.

### Internal
- Strengthened idempotency of code actions and auto-fix transformations.
- Expanded test suite to 22 passing tests.

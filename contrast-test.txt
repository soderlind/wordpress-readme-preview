This is a test plugin to demonstrate theme contrast improvements.

== Description ==

This section demonstrates various elements that should have good contrast in both light and dark themes:

**Bold text** and *italic text* should be clearly readable.

Here's some `inline code` that should be easily visible with proper background contrast.

Links like https://example.com should have good contrast ratios.

Here's a code block:

```php
<?php
function my_plugin_function() {
    $variable = 'This code should be easy to read';
    return $variable;
}
?>
```

> This is a blockquote that should also have proper contrast.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to your WordPress site
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen
3. Configure using `wp-config.php` constants:

```php
define('MY_PLUGIN_SETTING', true);
```

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
